I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my HTML elements.  The classes were defined correctly in my `tailwind.config.js` file, and I was importing Tailwind's CSS file into my HTML, yet the styles weren't rendering.  I tried various troubleshooting steps such as restarting my development server, clearing my browser's cache, and checking for typos, but the problem persisted.  The HTML element in question is a simple `<div>` with the class `bg-blue-500`.
