The issue was resolved by carefully reviewing the CSS specificity. Another CSS rule with higher specificity was overriding the Tailwind class.  The fix involved adjusting the CSS to ensure the Tailwind class has the proper specificity to apply correctly.  In some cases, restarting the development server may also solve this issue.  Also, check that your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and that the PurgeCSS or similar processes aren't accidentally removing the necessary styles.
